To install Terminal Pacity, go to A: and type INSTALL. This will take you
to the Installation program - follow onscreen instructions from there on in.

Please note that Terminal Pacity plays just as well in a Windows 95 DOS Shell,
albeit slightly slower. It has gone untested in a Legacy Windows DOS Shell.
