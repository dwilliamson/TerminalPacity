Before you start editing the graphics from each level (remember, the .GTF
files are really PCX files only with a different extension) consider the
amount of blocks you will have to copy and paste and then paste the platforms
over. I designed the graphics for the fire level this way and it took a long
time, so I made this program which will do the task for you.

Usage
-----
First of all you need to create your block. To do this, create a 256 colour
PCX file of width 16 and height 16. Now use this whole space to draw your
block - you cannot however use more than 50 colours on this block so if you
have originally rendered it (like I did using POV-Ray and Fractint for the
textures) use your paint program to reduce the number of colours. This is
because other game colours have to fit in too.

Once you've finished and saved your block all you have to do is type...

   B2PCX <name>.PCX

...and you will be immediately confronted with a picture of what your newly
constructed GTF file is like. Press any key and this will be saved to disk
instantly as <name>.GTF.

This newly constructed GTF file can be now loaded up in the level editor!!!

Have fun and be creative, try altering some of the monsters and collective
things - also, maybe edit the platform outlines but be careful what colours
you change. The top most colour must stay that of its original because the
game originally did collision detection on a colour basis (eeugh :).
