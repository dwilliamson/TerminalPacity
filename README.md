# Terminal Pacity

I wrote this game at the age of 16 while at school and sold it as Shareware.

Layout:

* EMS: Expanded memory management routines.
* POVRay: Source files for all artwork, authored for the Persistence of Vision Raytracer.
* PacEdit: Source code and executables for the game level editor.
* PacMan: Source code and executables for the game.
* dosgui: DOS installer GUI for the game.
* TerminalPacity.zip: Playable full game and editor on Windows using embedded DOSBox.
* termpac.zip: Installer for the Shareware version.

DOSBox or similar is required to run this game.
