# Terminal Pacity

I wrote this game at the age of 16 while at school and sold it as Shareware.

Layout:

* POVRay: Source files for all artwork, authored for the Persistence of Vision Raytracer.
* PacEdit: Source code and executables for the game level editor.
* PacMan: Source code and executables for the game.
